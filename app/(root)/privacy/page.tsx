                        This Privacy Policy is intended to provide a general overview of our policies in respect of the
                        collection, handling and management of your personal information. Your personal information
                        is any information or opinion about you that can identify you. Other
                        policies may override this
                        Privacy Policy in certain circumstances. For example, when we collect personal information
                        from you, we may advise a specific purpose for collecting that personal information, in which
                        case we will handle your personal information in accordance with that stated purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This Policy is intended to cover most personal information handled by us (and our authorised
                        agents who collect personal information on our behalf) but is not exhaustive. If you have any
                        queries about our management of your personal information, you are encouraged to contact
                        our Privacy Officer for further information (see section 11 below).
                        You are agreeing to be bound by this Privacy Policy by voluntarily providing us with your personal
                        information.

                                impracticable, from third parties (such as market research companies acting on our behalf) that
                                have collected it from you. Where we collect personal information
                                from third parties, we will
                                take reasonable steps to notify you or otherwise

                                information and the circumstances of its collection. We limit the personal information we
                                collect to that which is reasonably necessary for one or more of our functions or activities.
                                When collecting personal information, we will take reasonable steps to make you aware of the
                                purposes for which the information is being collected by us, the organisations to which we
                                would usually disclose your information, the main consequences for you if you fail to provide

                                to overseas recipients as well as the countries any such recipients are located in. This Privacy
                                Policy provides these details as they typically apply in most cases, however different details
                                may apply depending on our specific interaction with you. If we do not notify you of such other
                                details, the information in this Privacy Policy applies.

                                reasonable steps to notify you of them.
